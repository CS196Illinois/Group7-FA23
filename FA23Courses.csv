Literature studied in this class will include poetry, prose, drama, and fiction, possibly including works by Charlotte Brontë, Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, Mary Seacole, Thomas Carlyle, Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning, Christina Rossetti, William Morris, Oscar Wilde, H.G.

Fall	2023	ENGL	Early British Literature and Culture	209	"This course surveys more than a thousand years of British literature from the early Middle Ages through the Renaissance and well into the eighteenth century. But what does ""British literature"" really mean, especially in the context of an island archipelago populated by multiple nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) and repeatedly subjected to foreign rule (either by violent invasion or dynastic succession)? The range of texts we thus characterize as ""early British literature"" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the sixth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres. Our authors will range from the famous (e.g., Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton) to the lesser-known (e.g., Marie de France, Lady Mary Wroth, and Eliza Haywood) to the unknown (e.g., the anonymous Beowulf-poet).

This course explores three pedagogical paradigms: ""didactic"", ""authentic"" and ""transformative"" learning. It takes a historical perspective in order to define the contemporary dimensions of what we term ""new learning"". It prepares participants to make purposeful choices and link particular theories/instructional approaches to individual and group learning goals. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours."		3 OR 4 hours	
Fall	2023	EPOL	Learning Technologies	483	Addresses two important needs of educators. First, educators should be aware of recent developments in the area of instructional technology.

How can we use the affordances of networked digital media to do something different?

We consider how different dimensions of inequality have evolved over time, with special focus on inequalities across race, class, and gender. We assess how inequality shapes the lives of individuals in society, how and why inequality persists, and how people have worked to both challenge and reproduce their places in society. We approach social inequality from a variety of angles, developing an understanding of how inequality works in and through schooling, labor markets, employment, identity and prejudice, social mobility, and the role of major social institutions such as work, family, education, politics and law. We examine core statements of social stratification from sociology and engage with contemporary theories from sociology, psychology, political science, and economics.
